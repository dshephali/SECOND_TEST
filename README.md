# SECOND_TEST
This repo is a test repo for branch merging lesson
I am starting from here since this file already shows as on Branch Age_Analysis rather than Main and i am following 2nd part of prof David's video to finish the age_analysis branch merging' , i did git restore since i mistyped the commit command
Now i am doing Student Do: Git Branching and Pushing exercise and creating another branch called New-branch which will be merged with git at the end of this exercise. I was not sure if i was supposed to update here as i tried to create a new README.md but when i said OPEN README.md it brought me back here so my understanding is that that's because SECOND_TEST is the root directory , not New-branch
